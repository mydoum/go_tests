Purpose :

CODE CHALLENGE: Reverse Complement Problem.
 - Reverse complement a nucleotide pattern.
     Input: A DNA string Pattern.
     Output: !nrettaP, the reverse complement of Pattern.

my personnal constraints :

- Introduce flags to tell to the applications which function we apply

----
CODE CHALLENGE2: Solve the Pattern Matching Problem (restated below).

Pattern Matching Problem: Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
     Input: Two strings, Pattern and Genome.
     Output: All starting positions where Pattern appears as a substring of Genome.

----
CODE CHALLENGE3: Solve the Clump Finding Problem (restated below). You will need
to make sure that your algorithm is efficient enough to handle a large dataset.

Clump Finding Problem: Find patterns forming clumps in a string.
     Input: A string Genome, and integers k, L, and t.
     Output: All distinct k-mers forming (L, t)-clumps in Genome.

How to use it ?

This program is made with the Go language.
If you don't have a go-compiler please follow the page : http://golang.org/doc/install

If you have Brew:
42sh$ brew install go

[the folder containing src&bin&pkg must be in your $GOPATH in process of compiling the package]

Then you just have to launch the Makefile with the command:
42sh$ make
42sh$ ./bio main.go -rfoch path_file

-h [--help] shows the help
-f [--frequent] display the most frequent sequences in the dna
-r [--reverse] gives the complement strand and reverse it
-o [--occurrence] shows the positions of the pattern in the dna
-c [--clump] find patterns forming clumps in a string
